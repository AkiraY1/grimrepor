## Overview

Welcome to **Grim Repor** — an AI-powered framework designed to **resurrect dead dependencies**. We identify research papers with code using our vigilante that roams the internet that finds broken or outdated Python dependencies and **fixes them** so your code runs smoothly again.

**You are here because we found your broken repository.**  
Give us a new repo, and we’ll put it’s back in action. We are dedicated to keeping great research projects alive, allowing researchers to focus on **what matters most**: innovation.

## What We Do

1. **Scan & Identify**: Our AI scans repositories, identifying broken or outdated dependencies.
2. **Fix & Upgrade**: We automatically fix version mismatches, upgrade dead dependencies, and ensure compatibility with modern environments.
3. **Deliver Working Code**: Once the fixes are in place, we provide a working version of your repository — so you and your users can focus on research, not debugging.
